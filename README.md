# Image Editor Application

## Introduction

The **Image Editor Application** is a versatile tool built using Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and OpenCV for image processing tasks. This application enables users to upload, edit, and save images with various functionalities such as cropping, adding text, drawing, applying filters, adjusting levels, rotating, flipping, and more.

## Features Overview

- **Upload Image:** Allows users to select and upload an image file from their local system.
- **Crop Image:** Enables users to crop a specific region of the image by dragging a rectangle over it.
- **Add Text:** Provides functionality to overlay text on the image with options to choose text, font color, and position.
- **Draw Over Image:** Allows users to draw over the image using a selected color.
- **Apply Filters:** Offers a variety of filters like negative, black and white, stylization, sketch effect, emboss, sepia, binary thresholding, erosion, and dilation.
- **Blur/Smoothing:** Provides options for averaging blur, Gaussian blur, and median blur with adjustable parameters.
- **Adjust Levels:** Allows users to adjust brightness and saturation levels of the image.
- **Rotate and Flip:** Enables rotating the image left/right and flipping it vertically/horizontally.
- **Save As:** Allows users to save the edited image with their desired filename and format.

## Implementation

### 1. GUI Development with Tkinter's ttk Module

- Tkinter is a standard Python library for creating GUI applications.
- The application's GUI is designed using Tkinter's ttk (themed Tkinter) module, which provides a set of enhanced widgets with a modern look and feel.
- Widgets such as buttons, labels, frames, scales, and canvas are used to create the user interface.
- The GUI layout is organized using frames, allowing for better organization and management of widgets.

### 2. Image Processing with OpenCV

- OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful library for computer vision and image processing tasks.
- Image processing tasks such as cropping, filtering, blurring, adjusting levels, rotating, flipping, etc., are performed using OpenCV functions and algorithms.
- OpenCV provides efficient implementations of various image processing algorithms, allowing for fast and accurate processing of images.

### 3. Modular Code Structure

- The code is organized into classes and methods, following the principles of object-oriented programming.
- Each functionality of the application is encapsulated within separate methods, making the code modular and easy to maintain.
- This modular approach facilitates code reusability and extensibility, allowing for easy addition or modification of features.

### 4. Event-Driven Programming

- Event-driven programming paradigm is utilized for implementing interactive features such as cropping, drawing, and selecting colors.
- Event bindings are used to associate functions with specific events such as mouse clicks, mouse movements, etc.
- For example, when the user clicks and drags the mouse to crop an image, corresponding event handlers are triggered to capture the mouse movements and perform cropping accordingly.

### 5. Efficient Algorithms from OpenCV

- The application leverages efficient algorithms provided by OpenCV for various image manipulation and filtering tasks.
- These algorithms are optimized for performance and accuracy, allowing for real-time processing of images.
- For example, algorithms for blurring, filtering, thresholding, morphological operations, etc., are used to enhance and modify images according to user input.

## Future Scope

The future scope of this application lies in the integration of a **green screen feature**. By developing algorithms for color detection and segmentation, users will be able to replace the background of an image with one of their choosing. This feature will enable seamless integration of custom backgrounds, enhancing user creativity and allowing for the creation of composite images with personalized backgrounds tailored to individual preferences. Additionally, the inclusion of the green screen feature will broaden the application's versatility, making it suitable for a variety of use cases such as social media, presentations, and digital art. Overall, the implementation of the green screen feature aims to enrich the user experience and expand the functionality of the Image Editor Application.

## Conclusion

The Image Editor Application demonstrates the integration of Tkinter and OpenCV libraries to create a user-friendly interface for image editing tasks. Through a combination of intuitive controls and powerful image processing capabilities, users can easily enhance and modify their images according to their preferences. This project serves as a valuable learning experience for understanding GUI development and image processing techniques in Python, making it suitable for independent study or as a basis for further exploration into advanced topics in computer vision and graphical interfaces.
